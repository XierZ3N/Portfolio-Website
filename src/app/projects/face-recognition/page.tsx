            <span className="font-bold text-white">Summary:</span> A Python-based real-time Face Recognition System built using OpenCV and face_recognition library.
Developed a complete pipeline: face dataset collection â†’ encoding â†’ real-time recognition.
Implemented automated dataset capture via webcam for seamless user enrollment.
Built an encoding generator to store facial embeddings in a serialized format (pickle).
Designed a real-time recognition system that identifies known faces from live video feed.
Incorporated attendance logging (Name + Timestamp) into CSV files for practical use cases like classrooms or small offices.
Optimized for Mac M2 hardware, successfully running with Continuity Camera & native webcam.
Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, dlib/face_recognition, NumPy, CSV
Future Improvements:
Incremental dataset updates without retraining.
Anti-spoofing (preventing photo/video hacks).
GUI/Web Dashboard for attendance management.
ðŸ‘‰ This project demonstrates skills in computer vision, real-time systems, and applied machine learning, making it scalable toward real-world applications like office/classroom attendance tracking.
